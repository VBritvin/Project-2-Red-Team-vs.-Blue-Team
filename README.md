In the Red Team vs. Blue Team scenario I played the role of both pentester and SOC analyst.

***Project Objectives:*** 

*a) Penetration testing with Kali Linux;*
*b) Log and incident analysis with Kibana;*
*c) System hardening and configuration;*
*d) Reporting, documentation, and communication.*

​	As the **Red Team**, I attacked a vulnerable VM within my environment, ultimately gaining root access to the machine. 
​	As the **Blue Team**, I used Kibana to review logs taken during the Stage 1 engagement. I used the logs to extract hard data and visualizations for my report. Then, I interpreted my log data to suggest mitigation measures for each exploit that I've successfully performed.
